# My Library API

I created **My Library API** based on a tutorial series [Let's Build a Node.js REST API] (https://lo-victoria.com/series/lets-build-a-nodejs-rest-api) write by [Victoria Lo] (https://github.com/victoria-lo).

Well, this project is a little bit different than what she teach in her tutorial series, and i will create new functionalites when i have time, but for now, is that.
